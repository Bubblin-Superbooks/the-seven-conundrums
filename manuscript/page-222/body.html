He kept on thrusting his hands into his pockets and taking them out again. There was an expression in his eyes which angered me.</p><p>"I suppose he's rather a handful," I said.</p><p>Duncombe, who had been strolling about the room, joined us just in time to hear the last remark.</p><p>"He is that," he admitted, "and yet, after all, I suppose I ought not to grumble. I'm well enough paid for looking after him. A word with you, Lister."</p><p>He drew me away to the farther end of the room. We stepped out of the open window on to the broad gravel path.
