A determined attempt was made at a rescue, and a  free fight took place outside the Watergate Street police station, all the windows of which were broken. With the arrest of Mountjoy, who will be charged with no less than five murders, it is hoped that the whole conspiracy of which he was the head will be broken up.

The chief constable has received a telephone message of congratulation from Scotland</blockquote></div> </div>
