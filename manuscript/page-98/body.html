<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">go. I can't tell what surprises may be in store for me. I may get an invitation myself."</p><p>Rose turned a troubled face towards me. Her lips quivered a little, her eyes were full of distress.</p><p>"Maurice," she confessed, "I'm afraid of  to-morrow. I'm afraid that we are being made use of to rob Mr. Kinlosti."</p><p>"Can't be helped," Leonard put in, as I remained for a moment silent. "We took this business on with our eyes open. Our consciences weren't very active when we were starving and cold and in debt. It's no good finding them too sensitive now that we're living on the fat of the land. We've just got to see the thing through, for a year, at any rate."</p><p>"Leonard is right," I assented. "We've got to grin and bear it. This time," I added, "it seems as though you two were going to have the show to yourself."</p><p>"You can have my share," Rose sighed.</p></div> </div>
