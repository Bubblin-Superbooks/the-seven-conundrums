<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Arthur, after a preliminary fit of gloom, drank far too much champagne for his age and became, in his rather clumsy way, as light-hearted as the rest. He and Ella sat for some time apart from the others, his arm drawn through hers, until presently they wandered off together to look for Venetian shells, the spoils of some long-forgotten shipwreck. On the whole, the excursion which I had seen foredoomed to failure, turned out a great success. Duncombe only once, during the rest of the afternoon, referred to the disturbing subject.</p><p>"You don't suppose," he suggested, "that Arthur is thinking any more about that little affair, eh?"</p><p>"Why should he?" I answered coolly. "He must know that you made a mistake."</p><p>"Naturally," Duncombe assented. "I still don't think he'd have come to any harm unless  he bungled his dive, but I'm glad, all the same, that you noticed the rocks."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">That marked the end of the incidents worthy of note</p></div> </div>
